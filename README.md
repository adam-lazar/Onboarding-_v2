3.  <!--# others steps to complete -->
4.  Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!

## Ignored files in .gitignore
We place a list of folders and files that are ignored for synchronization from the userâ€™s client computer to Github and beyond.  These are usually passwords, login credentials, project management or log files used by your IDE or other work environment.We by default, excluded all Posit/RStudio standards, and usually all Jupiter Notebook standards, and a few Windows/Mac specific files.
We also ignore a standard folder called `not_included`,  which serves as the place of your personal scrapbook, sandbox, that you do not want to share with anybody.

# Folders

`Folders` appear like this in this repository.

We have two data folders:

`data-raw`: Raw, unprocessed data, as received, downloaded, collected

`data`: This folder contains the processed data or our outputs.

We save visualizations in folders corresponding to the file format.

`png`: contains visualizations in Portable Network Graphics format (our preferred format.)

`jpg`: Contains visualizations in Joint Photographic Experts Group format.

`webp`: Contains visualizations in WebP format. We prefer this for content intended for web use (presentations, blogposts), because it works much faster and better with browsers than PNG or JPG.

<br>

`docs:` This folder contains output files created by Quatro.

`bib`: Contains all bibliography: used citations, data used, visualisation used, datasets created, visualizations created, public text document outputs created.

## Standard File Names

1.  Use only lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphen (`-`), underscore (`_`).
2.  Instead of using space, use `-` between words and abbreviations.
3.  Use underscore `_` between shorthand descriptions, dates, and other semantically different parts of the filename.
4.  If you use dates in file names, use the `YYYYMMDD` standard.
5.  Use a subfolder for logically connected intermediary files.

For example:

`data-raw/places/atelier-hungary-places_2012_20230316.xlsx`

`data-raw/persons/atelier-hungary-photographers_2012_20230316.xlsx`

## Tidy data

Make all tables [tidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).

-   Use only machine-readable and programmable variable names: variable names (columns) use `snake_case` or `lowerCamelCase`, without space, hyphen, and other special characters.
-   For row names, row identification, use only alphanumeric characters, for example, integer numbers, without `.` or any other character.
